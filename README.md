Cookie resource consumption denial of service testing tool.

This tool is adapted off of the proof of concept tool I created for CVE-2019-16889.

This tool differs from the original poc in which that it allows you to define the cookie value.  This allows the tool to be used to test any cookie value regardless of architecture for resource consumption.

Please feel free to comment and or make suggestions to make this better!
